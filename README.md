# twitter-bot

A simple bot used to follow back users on Twitter. It does this with the assistance of the Tweepy library. 
Permission was obtained from Twitter to use elevated access when interacting with their API.
A separate file includes the API keys and access tokens which has not been uploaded to Github for security purposes.
