A simple Twitter Bot used to follow back users and like certain tweets based on a kwyword provided. It does this with the assistance of the Tweepy library. 
Permission was obtained from Twitter to use elevated access when interacting with their API.
A separate file includes the API keys and access tokens which has not been uploaded to Github for security purposes.
